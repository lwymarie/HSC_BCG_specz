Significance of spec-z for building cluster catalogs...

Currently, the total number of galaxies in the cluster catalogs with spectroscopic redshifts is 
XX. With Kast observations, we will eventually add 61 galaxies in three different GAMA fields that 
currently only have photometric redshifts in the catalogs. We cut this target sample at stellar 
mass $M_*>10^{11.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, with nearby pair at $<1$\,Mpc, and at 
$0.25<z_{\rm phot}<0.55$. We make a generous cut on photometric redshifts to ensure that all 
$0.3 < z < 0.5$ objects are covered. 

Our major analysis work is to fit the Kast spectra with independent component stellar templates 
using pPXF (Cappellari \& Emsellem 2004), with emphasis on the 4000\,\AA\ break. We were granted 
director's discretionary time in 2017 July for a trial Kast run. We observed four galaxies that 
have spectroscopic redshifts already determined in SDSS, to determine the signal-to-noise required 
for deriving reliable spectroscopic redshifts using Kast, and the brightness limit of the 
galaxies. We observed four galaxies of SDSS magnitude $r=20.0$, $r=19.3$, $r=18.4$, and $r=18.8$, 
each with exposure time $3600\textrm{---}7200$\,s. We performed preliminary data reduction using 
PYPIT. Figure 1 shows the Kast spectra smoothed for clarity, the SDSS spectra, and the models. 
While proper fluxing and cosmic ray rejection are still in progress, we demonstrated that 
signal-to-noise of $\approx5$ is sufficient for measuring redshift with precision of 
$XX\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. In turn, this implies our program is feasible for galaxies with $r<20.0$.

\section{Targets and Exposures}

We will use the Shane 3m telescope and the Kast spectrograph to observe a sample of 39 early-type 
galaxies that currently have photometric redshifts, in three different fields covered by GAMA, 
named GAMA-A, GAMA-B, and GAMA-C. Given the faintness of our targets, dark time is preferred.  

The SDSS $r$-band magnitudes for our targets range between XX and XX. Our science goal will 
require $\sim7200$\,s of exposure to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise. These long exposures will 
be broken into 1800\,s exposures as a compromise between CCD read noise and cosmic ray 
accumulation. 
With overhead we expect we can observe $\approx3$ targets per night. To observe a total of 39 
targets, 13 nights are required at minimum. If available, this program could use an additional 4 
nights to account for unfavorable observing conditions and possibly observe additional galaxies in 
the whole Hyper Suprime-Cam footprint. Figure 2 shows the visibility curves of the four fields to 
be observed on 2018 February 1 and 2018 June 1. Because of the low declination, our targets are 
only observable in a relatively narrow range of time in a semester. We request time allocation in 
March and April when more of our targets are within the telescope pointing limit. 

We will setup to resolve the 4000~\AA\ break and other major spectroscopic features such as 
the Ca II H and K lines, while simultaneously cover a sufficiently broad wavelength range for full 
SED fitting (Figure 1). As a compromise of the above two requirements, we will use the 600/5000 
grating on the red side. 

Table 1 lists all the galaxies in the targeted fields. We will observe additional targets in the 
Hyper Suprime-Cam footprint if we run out of targets. 

In poor observing conditions we will increase exposure time and give preference to bright targets.

\section{Supplementary Observations Required from other Observatories}

Our full cluster catalogs include spectroscopic redshift catalogs from the GAMA team.

\subsection{Status of Previously Approved 3-m Programs}

This program obtained director's discretionary time of one night in 2017A. 

PI Lau is a graduate student at UCSC, who has been awarded a total of 22 nights in 2015A, 2016A, 
and 2017A for the program Late-time Optical Spectral Signatures of Tidal Disruption Candidates. 
The observing program is completed and the path to publication is active. 

Co-I Leauthaud and co-I Huang have extensive experience with optical spectroscopy and are experts 
in assive galaxies. 

Co-I Greg Sallaberry is an aspiring undergraduate researcher at UCSC, who will lead the observing 
and data reduction effort.
